# G2LP-Net: Global to Local Progressive Video Inpainting Networks

In this network, we propose to combine global and local self-attention to focus on the removal of irregularly slender occlusion.


Extensive experiments on DAVIS and Youtube-VOS datasets demonstrate our network achieves SOTA performance on large-scale occlusion videos and more importantly perform better in local texture recovery so as to produce results with less blurriness as video examples below.

This example shows our G2LP-Net is able to remove wires with much less blurriness compared to the SOTA self-attention based video inpainting method.

More examples are waiting to be uploaded...
