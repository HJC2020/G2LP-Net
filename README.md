# G2LP-Net: Global to Local Progressive Video Inpainting Networks

In this network, we propose to combine global and local self-attention to focus on the removal of irregularly slender occlusion.

Extensive experiments on DAVIS and Youtube-VOS datasets as well as our Wire-removal Video dataset demonstrate our network achieves SOTA performance on videos with large-scale occlusion and more importantly perform much better in local texture recovery so as to produce results with less blurriness as video examples below.

These examples show our G2LP-Net is able to remove wires with much less blurriness compared to the SOTA self-attention based video inpainting method.

More examples are waiting to be uploaded...
